**Welcome to My Master's Journey!

Hello and thanks for stopping by! I'm Ale, an architect from Tijuana, Mexico, now diving into the Master in Design for Emergent Futures at IAAC in Barcelona.

Now, I'm excited to explore how design can help shape more resilient, collective, and symbiotic futures. This site is where I'll document my journey, my projects, and my evolution throughout this master's.

Feel free to look around and see what emerges! **[my website](https://community.emergentfutures.io/courses/5566525/content)**
