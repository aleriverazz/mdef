More precisely, I asked when I feel I am embodying that ideal. This inquiry resonates with our lecture\u2019s exploration of the natural, femininity, beauty, and functionality. My personal investigation started with beauty: when do I feel like the best version of myself? The answer, perhaps oddly, is found in the process of getting my nails done. This feeling transcends mere aesthetics; it is an embodied experience. I started to research this sensation, focusing on my hands\u2014the primary extensions of my body that interact with the world. When they are adorned, I feel pretty, beautiful, and most authentically myself. Culturally, this practice carries significant meaning. Here in Europe, the long, extravagant nail art I grew up seeing in Latin American contexts is uncommon. This style\u2014the \u201cbling bling,\u201d the extra length, the pearls and stones\u2014is a specific cultural expression. Functionality is, in a sense, sacrificed; one\u2019s manual dexterity is compromised. Yet, this very sacrifice is what makes the presentation so powerfully symbolic. Who has the privilege to sit for two or three hours at eleven in the morning every three to four weeks? As Sayak Valencia might suggest, in the context of \u201cgore capitalism\u201d and the performance of identity, such aesthetics are not passive. Ornate, \u201cbling\u201d nails are a social signifier: they communicate that one has time, disposable income, and the power to spend a significant sum (over a thousand Mexican pesos monthly) on a non-essential part of the body. In this sense, a specific, hyper-feminine aesthetic becomes a form of power within Mexican society. This led me to an imaginative, speculative extreme: a concept of neobuchona, prosthetic nails. I envisioned what a hyper-norte\u00f1o, buch\u00f3n version of robotic nail prosthetics would look like\u2014excessive, gleaming, embedded with pearls and stones, screaming power and wealth. In a robotic future so often imagined as masculine, how would femininity, particularly this fronteriza femininity described by Valencia as a \u201cborderized\u201d and potent force, manifest? This is my exploration. In my daily life, I opt for clean, useful nails. I cut them when necessary, as I must work with my hands, on computers, and with machinery. I cannot afford that monthly financial or functional sacrifice. Yet, I still experience that potent feeling of being my best self with my own, more subdued taste of symbolic cleanliness and power\u2014a subtle assertion of identity and control right at my fingertips. my_website/docs/docs/assets/gif/1109.0.gif","title":"Living with your own Ideas"},{"location":"project/living-with-your-own-ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"To become the best version of yourself On Nails, Symbolic Power, and Becoming\u2026 I began by questioning what constitutes the \u201cbest version\u201d of oneself.
