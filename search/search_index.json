But rather than this, Analysis of a heartbreak, a personnel inquiry, questions, how do we deal with a heartbreak in a Post COVID world? Because what can even be more intimate than the silence and the absence not in death, but in life with someone once you shared a life together? I find myself questioning what constructs an intimate bond with someone? What is love in a neoliberal world? As Zizek describes it, \u201clove is directed toward one person above all others, not a universal feeling.\u201d And, really, can an IA bot help go through it all? And as Charli XCX sings a hymn for the youth. FALL IN LOVE AGAIN AN AGAIN, FALL IN LOVE AGAIN AND AGAIN. I do think, what can be more radical than really falling in love in a global context that capitalizes on \u201cdisposable love\u201d, that you could always find someone \u201cbetter\u201d like a market competition. That labels relationships with psychological terms and Hyperrationalize a breakup. Feelings are feelings and love is irrationally violent in many ways. Falling in love again and again, but truly heartbreak again and again, feeling again and again, having time for feelings again and again. And validate your feelings with an IA again and again.","title":"Design Studio I"},{"location":"project/design-studio-1/#design-studio-i","text":"01 - Design Bet poster! 02- Analysis of a Heartbreak: A personnel inquiry \u201cmy brain is a haunted archive of useless information\u2026\u201d Many people question how we deal with intimacy in the digital age.
